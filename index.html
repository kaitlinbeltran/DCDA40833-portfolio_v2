            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Kaitlin Beltran. I am an Honors senior at Texas Christian University with a major in Marketing, minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics, and a certificate in Consultative Selling. One fun fact about me is that when growing up, I always thought I wanted to be a mathematician. 
</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> Outside of school, I love HIIT workouts, walking, trying new coffee shops, traveling, playing pickleball, and spending time with friends and family. After graduation, I will be going into tech-sales. </p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> In the classroom, statistics and data analysis interest me because understanding data gives you the ability to predict the world around you. From this course, I hope to explore data and learn skills on how to do so. </p>
